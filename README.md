Scala Tutorial 10 Tutorial

##

1. Write a Scala function called calculateAverage that takes a list of temperatures as input and uses the map function to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit, and then uses the reduce function to calculate the average Fahrenheit temperature. The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: (C * 9/5) + 32.<br />
Example: 
Input: [0, 10, 20, 30]<br />
Output: Average Fahrenheit temperature: 59.0<br />
Implement the calculateAverage function using the map and reduce methods.<br /><br />
2. Write a Scala function called countLetterOccurrences that takes a list of words as input and uses the map function to transform the words into their respective lengths (number of letters), and then uses the reduce function to calculate the total count of letter occurrences in all the words combined.
<br />Example: 
Input: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"] Output: Total count of letter occurrences: 21<br />
Implement the countLetterOccurrences function using the map and reduce methods.
